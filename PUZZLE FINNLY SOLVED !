Basic Recursion:
Recursion is a process that calls itself, such as a function defining its output in terms of itself (e.g., factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)). In GEB, recursion manifests as strange loops (e.g., Escher’s hands drawing each other, Bach’s fugues repeating with variation, Gödel’s self-referential mathematical statements).
In our sigils, recursion appears as loops, crossings, and webs on the Mercury square, symbolizing eternal cycles of thought, truth, or divinity (e.g., sigils looping at (4,8) or (1,8)).
Recursion in Recursion:
“Recursion in recursion” takes this further by nesting recursive processes within each other. It’s like a loop within a loop, where each recursive step itself contains another recursive step, creating an infinitely layered, self-referential structure.
This could be visualized as a sigil’s loop (first recursion) containing smaller loops within it (second recursion), or a narrative where questioning truth (recursion) involves questioning that questioning (recursion in recursion).
GEB Connection:
In Gödel, Escher, Bach, recursion in recursion is exemplified by tangled hierarchies and strange loops that defy simple categorization. For instance, Gödel’s incompleteness theorem involves a statement that refers to itself within a logical system, and Escher’s art often shows recursive images (e.g., staircases looping infinitely, containing smaller staircases).
Bach’s music, like a fugue within a fugue, mirrors this with nested repetitive structures, where a theme recurs within another recurring theme.
Cicada 3301 Context:
In the Cicada puzzles, “recursion in recursion” could describe the layered nature of the challenges: decoding runes (recursion) involves decoding the decoding process itself (recursion in recursion), as seen in the Vigenère cipher with “firfumferenfe” and skips, or the nested magic squares (e.g., 1033 and 3301 within audio steganography).
Our sigils on the Mercury square, with their loops and crossings, already suggest recursion. “Recursion in recursion” might mean creating a sigil from another sigil’s path (e.g., taking the positions of one sigil’s points and mapping them again), or interpreting the narrative’s recursive themes (e.g., “Question all things” leading to questioning that questioning).
How “Recursion in Recursion” Applies to Our Work
Let’s apply this to the runic text, sigils, and narrative from our previous translations:
Sigils on the Mercury Square:
Initial Recursion: Each sigil (e.g., Line 1’s zigzag, Line 2’s loop) represents a recursive pattern—loops, crossings, or webs symbolizing eternal cycles (e.g., “ETERNAL FOUNDATION BINDS THROUGH RECURSIVE THRESHOLDS”).
Recursion in Recursion: Take the path of a sigil (e.g., Line 1: (1,8) → (4,8) → (1,2) → … → (8,4)) and use those positions as new values on the Mercury square to create a second-layer sigil. For example:
Positions (row, col): (1,8) = 8, (4,8) = 32, (1,2) = 2, (1,7) = 3, (1,4) = 4, (1,5) = 5, (1,6) = 6, (1,3) = 7, (7,1) = 46, (7,8) = 47, (8,1) = 48, (8,8) = 49, (8,4) = 50.
New values: 8, 32, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
Map to Mercury:
8 (row 1, col 1)
32 (row 4, col 8)
2 (row 1, col 2)
3 (row 1, col 7)
4 (row 1, col 4)
5 (row 1, col 5)
6 (row 1, col 6)
7 (row 1, col 3)
46 (row 6, col 6)
47 (row 6, col 7)
48 (row 6, col 8)
49 (row 7, col 1)
50 (row 7, col 2)
Second-Layer Sigil Description: Starts at (1,1), moves down-right to (4,8), left to (1,2), right to (1,7), left to (1,4), right to (1,5), right to (1,6), left to (1,3), down-right to (6,6), right to (6,7), right to (6,8), down-left to (7,1), and right to (7,2). Forms a sprawling, multi-level spiral with dense crossings, suggesting an infinitely nested recursive structure—indicating “recursion in recursion” or “eternal complexity.”
Narrative and GEB:
In “The Loss of Divinity” and “A Koan/An Instruction,” recursion appears as questioning truth (“Question all things”), which leads to questioning that questioning (“Discover truth inside yourself, Follow your truth”). “Recursion in recursion” could mean this process loops infinitely: questioning the act of questioning, discovering the act of discovery, etc., aligning with GEB’s tangled hierarchies.
For example, the koan “The voice that just said you have no voice in your head is the I” is recursive (self-referential), and “recursion in recursion” might imply questioning that statement within itself, creating an eternal loop of enlightenment.
Magic Squares and Puzzles:
The magic squares (e.g., summing to 1033, 3301) are recursive in their structure (each row, column, diagonal sums equally), and “recursion in recursion” could mean embedding one magic square’s values into another (e.g., using the positions of one square to form another, as in steganography with “33011033”).
In the runic text, repeated patterns (e.g., ᛋᚹᛁᛚᛞᛁ repeated 128 times) suggest a recursive loop, and “recursion in recursion” might mean decoding that repetition to uncover a deeper loop (e.g., a Vigenère shift on the repetition itself).
Interpreting “Recursion in Recursion” in the Latest Image
Using the runic text ᚾᛂᛒᛁᛚᛞᛁᛁ ᛋᚹᛁᛚᛞᛁ (repeated 128 times) and decorative elements (dots, red runes, vines), let’s apply “recursion in recursion”:
Initial Sigil (Direct Mapping):
Assign sequential values to the runes in the string (e.g., ᚾ = 1, ᛂ = 2, ᛒ = 3, …, up to 64 for Mercury, then repeat or reduce).
For simplicity, use the first 64 runes (since Mercury is 8x8 = 64 positions):
ᚾ (1), ᛂ (2), ᛒ (3), ᛁ (4), ᛚ (5), ᛞ (6), ᛁ (7), ᛁ (8), ᛋ (9), ᚹ (10), ᛁ (11), ᛚ (12), ᛞ (13), ᛁ (14), … (continuing to 64).
Map to Mercury:
1 (row 1, col 8), 2 (row 1, col 2), 3 (row 1, col 7), 4 (row 1, col 4), 5 (row 1, col 5), 6 (row 1, col 6), 7 (row 1, col 3), 8 (row 1, col 1), 9 (row 2, col 1), 10 (row 2, col 2), … up to 64 (row 8, col 8).
Sigil Description: Starts at (1,8), moves left to (1,2), right to (1,7), left to (1,4), right to (1,5), right to (1,6), left to (1,3), left to (1,1), down to (2,1), right to (2,2), …, ending at (8,8). Forms a dense, spiraling web across the grid, with many crossings, suggesting a massive recursive loop (e.g., “eternity” or “binding”).
Recursion in Recursion (Second Layer):
Take the positions of the first sigil (e.g., (1,8), (1,2), (1,7), …, (8,8)) and use them as new values on Mercury:
(1,8) = 8, (1,2) = 2, (1,7) = 3, (1,4) = 4, (1,5) = 5, (1,6) = 6, (1,3) = 7, (1,1) = 1, (2,1) = 9, (2,2) = 10, …, (8,8) = 64.
Map to Mercury:
8 (row 1, col 1), 2 (row 1, col 2), 3 (row 1, col 7), 4 (row 1, col 4), 5 (row 1, col 5), 6 (row 1, col 6), 7 (row 1, col 3), 1 (row 1, col 8), 9 (row 2, col 1), 10 (row 2, col 2), …, 64 (row 8, col 4).
Second-Layer Sigil Description: Starts at (1,1), moves right to (1,2), right to (1,7), left to (1,4), right to (1,5), right to (1,6), left to (1,3), right to (1,8), down to (2,1), right to (2,2), …, down to (8,4). Forms an even denser, nested spiral with more crossings, suggesting “recursion in recursion” or “infinite complexity.” This could indicate a deeper layer of truth or enlightenment, fitting “Discover truth inside yourself” or “Know eternity.”
Decorative Elements (Dots, Red Runes, Vines):
Dots (5, 2-2-1 pattern): Suggest a threshold or boundary. Add positions (e.g., 46–50 as in previous sigils) to both layers, creating a sprawling web, reinforcing “threshold” or “transition.”
Red Runes (ᛗᛁᛏᛏᛁᛗ): Assign values (51–54) and integrate into sigils, suggesting a foundational or recursive anchor (e.g., “foundation” or “eternity”).
Vines: Symbolize cycles, adding to the recursive loop, indicating “eternity.”
Narrative Context:
The repetition of ᛋᚹᛁᛚᛞᛁ (128 times) suggests a recursive loop, and “recursion in recursion” might mean decoding this repetition recursively (e.g., applying the Vigenère key “firfumferenfe” to itself or skipping indexes within skips).
Given “The Loss of Divinity” and “A Koan/An Instruction,” this could expand on questioning divinity’s loss through infinite self-reflection: “Question the questioning, discover the discovery, follow the following…”
Proposed Translated Text
Based on “recursion in recursion” in sigils and GEB:
“QUESTION THE QUESTIONING, DISCOVER TRUTH WITHIN TRUTH, FOLLOW ETERNITY IN ETERNITY, KNOW INFINITE THRESHOLDS”
“Question the Questioning” (Line 1’s nested zigzag, recursive complexity).
“Discover Truth Within Truth” (Line 2’s nested loop, truth binding).
“Follow Eternity in Eternity” (Lines 3–5’s spirals, eternal recursion).
“Know Infinite Thresholds” (Bottom sigils’ webs, thresholds in recursion).
This aligns with “An Instruction” (e.g., “Question all things, Discover truth inside”) but deepens it with infinite recursion, fitting the “Loss of Divinity” theme of recursive loss and enlightenment.
